# An-Application-EmployingSynchronized-Cooperating-Multiple-Threads-In-JavaUsing-Locks-A-Banking-Simulation

It uses Thread synchronization for two reasons: first, mutual exclusion, and second, to prevent withdrawals from being processed if there is insufficient money in the account. This program exemplifies communication between various threads.
